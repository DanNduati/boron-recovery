# Device restoration test
## Description
---
### Assertion failure (10 blinks between 2 SOS patterns)

Assertion failure is triggered when a test for something that should never occur occurs, and there is no solution other than to SOS and restart. Code might do this if the internal state is invalid and not what is expected, for example. Or something that should never happen and is non-recoverable, for example if the system thread cannot be created. At the moment, all of the AssertionFailures are in things related to threads and the system thread, but thatâ€™s just because those are the only things that have been instrumented with an AssertionFailure panic.

## Steps undertaken
### Device restoration via USB
---
Only works if the device is in `DFU mode` which i cannot do on the bricked boards
### Device restoration via JTAG
---
Bricked particle Boron restoration tests with the Particle Debugger.I have written several bash scripts to make testing easier
- Connect the Particle Debugger ribbon cable between the debugger and device.
- Connect the device by USB to your computer
- Connect the Particle Debugger by USB to your computer
- Put the device in DFU mode (blinking yellow) by holding down MODE. Tap RESET and continue to hold down MODE while the status LED blinks magenta (red and blue at the same time) until it blinks yellow, then release MODE.
- Run the setup script
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```
    Output:
    ```bash

    The flash list command is done here for illustration purposes and to make sure the debugger can connect to the `boron device`.
- Program the bootloader
    Download the appropriate bootloader bin file from the [release site](https://github.com/particle-iot/device-os/releases) and run the flash_bootloader script
    ```bash
    ./flash_bootloader.sh
    ```

    So seems like i am successfully able to flash both the bootloader and the softdevice, all this however does not seem to recover the brinked devices from the assertion fault state. Looking into the documentation further the above flash procedure does not erase configuration ie the following are not erased:
    - Emulated EEPROM contents
    - Device Keys
    - Gen 3 Wi-Fi credentials, APN settings, antenna, and SIM selection configuration
    - Anything else in the DCT
    - Gen 3 flash file system contents
    
    On Gen 3 devices the Bootloader, Soft Device, UICR bytes, Device OS, and Tinker are restored.

    ToDo
    - [ ] Erase all available user flash (including UICR[User information configuration registers])
